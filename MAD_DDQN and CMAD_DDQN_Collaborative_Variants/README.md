# Double Deep Q Network (DDQN) for UAV-Assisted Networks

This project applies ideas from research literature to solve Atari OpenAI gym environments.

## Getting Started

1. Run the file: Main_DAMAD_sumo_Traffic.py or Main_DACEMAD_sumo_Traffic
2. Install required dependencies such as Numpy, gym, etc.

## Built With

* [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) - Deep learning Framework used along with Numpy to build Deep Q Networks.
* [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) - Provides environments to test Agent's performance

## Acknowledgments

This project was built referencing research papers on applying Q-learning with deep neural networks
